#+title: Euler equations

* General notes
- Euler equations neglect effects of fluid viscosity.
- Provide good model for some problems
  - e.g. lift of aerofoil at low angle of attack
- Do not provide good model for problems such as growth of boundary layer
  - Problems which are dependant on viscousity
- Must be solved simultaneously
  - Dependant vartiables appear in each equation
- Analytical solutions difficult to obtain
- Can be obtained from [[id:917a4eb2-c4c0-4bbf-83d8-ed65ccef18f2][Navier-Stokes equations]] at high Reynolds numbers

  By considering fluid shear stresses on the control volume, forms the [[id:917a4eb2-c4c0-4bbf-83d8-ed65ccef18f2][Navier-Stokes equations]].

Use in conjuction with [[id:ad8a5073-fd5d-4c39-8b28-749060131385][Mass continuity equation]].

* 2-Dimensional, steady form
- LHS represents advection of fluid
- RHS represents pressure gradient of the flow
  
** X Momentum
(\partial(\rho u^2))/(\partial x) + (\partial(\rho uv))/(\partial y) = -(\partial p)/(\partial x)
** Y Momentum
(\partial(uv))/(\partial x) + (\partial(\rho v^2))/(\partial y) = -(\partial p)/(\partial y)
