# Introduction

This repository contains my notes, created using org-roam, for my second semester fourth year modules of my MEng engineering course.

It contains notes on the following subjects:
- Aerodynamics
- Aircraft propulsion systems
- Computational Fluid Dynamics

# Notes
I no longer use org-roam, these notes are unfinished, not fully linked, and there are some minor errors in the CFD notes.
