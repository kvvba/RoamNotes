#+title: Incidence flow

[[id:2b5b47ae-cc62-4cae-8895-7d444a9511e2][Thin]] flat plate aerofoil is represented by a collection of vorticies.

The circulation per unit chordwise length of those vorticies is given by loading distribution \gamma(x).
The circulation contained in a small length element dx is \gamma(x)dx
Taking the circulation over a loop of length dx, as in [[id:54e6fb44-f9a9-4515-920b-9c3ada22d266][Circulation]], exact at the plate:
\gamma(x)dx = u'_top - u'_bottom

Aerofoil velocity comes only from the vortex, so:
u'_top = \gamma(x)/2
u'_bottom = -\gamma(x)/2

Insert into pressure coefficient [[id:5ed93b04-7d4e-4c12-9c0f-fd4e9bca3b02][Theoretical pressure coefficient]].
