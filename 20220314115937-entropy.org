#+title: Entropy

dS = (\delta Q)/T

Entropy is a measure of the order of a system. The higher the entropy, the more disordered the system.

Proceeding in an infinitesimally gradual manner results in the system remaining at constant entropy, this is known as an isentropic process. Isentropic processes produce maximum work output.
In reality this is not possible, and so the [[id:0cff770f-30ce-42f8-aa7a-1199c88fdb56][Isentropic efficiency]] relates the ideal process to the real process.
