#+title: Isentropic efficiency

An isentropic process is one which does not increase [[id:bb975d06-10f8-41d2-b7cc-b0cb3af6393a][Entropy]]. In reality this is not possible and so the isentropic efficiency relates the actual process to the ideal.

Isentropic process:
T_is/T_1 = (p_2/p_1)^((\gamma - 1)/\gamma)

The isentropic efficiency is defined as:

* [[id:841a1d13-5409-4bb8-bd35-5cbdcd423b6a][Compressor efficiency]]
\eta_comp = (T_2,is - T_1)/(T_2 - T_1) = (h_2,is - h_1)/(h_2 - h_1)

* [[id:102568d2-a06b-416f-9037-1ce6c86164db][Turbine efficiency]]
\eta_turb = (T_2 - T_1)/(T_2,is - T_1) = (h_2 - h_1)/(h_2,is - T_1)

This does not work across multiple stages.
In a compressor, a lower isentropic efficiency will be calculated across all stages compared to calculating each stage individually. In turbines, a higher efficiency will be calculated.
For multistage calculations, [[id:06d06c29-66b3-4919-be38-ff91f884043d][Polytropic efficiency]] is needed.
