#+title: Gas turbine engine basics

* How a gas turbine engine works
1. Air is drawn into the engine and compressed
   - Most modern jet engines have axial compressors
   - Also possible to have centrifugal compressors
   - Air maintains same velocity, size of passage decreases
     - Increases pressure and temperature
   - Large increase in pressure across compressor
2. Air is heated in the combustion chamber and expands
   - Mixed with fuel and burnt
   - Air expands
   - Constant pressure
3. Some of this energy in the air forms the propulsive jet
4. Some is turned into mechanical power in the turbine, driving the compressor
   - Smaller decrease in pressure across turbine

* Notes
- Max thrust wanted for jet engines
- For energy generation, want maximum energy from turbine
- Performance determined by air characteristics
  - For aviation purposes determined by [[id:fbf46af4-7bac-468c-8341-316eafb0c830][International standard atmosphere]]
- Some air sucked in by the fan is directed around the engine core through the bypass ducts. It rejoins the flow at the nozzle.
