#+title: Error validation

Minimise [[id:d2175b22-bd20-4003-bb06-996e301bba07][Modelling errors]] by comparison to experiment.

- Validate models with available experimental measurements
- If measurements are not available, validate with open literature cases for similar flows
- May also use [[id:09bf99d7-e7ec-46d2-90f8-763ef2a9fd14][Direct numerical simulation (DNS)]] for validation
- Assess modelling approach by considering different models
- If application is new, be careful

* Avoiding numerical errors
** Uncertainties
- Careful selection of test case
- Check of consistency of experimental data
- Check of sensitivity of assumptions made
- Communication with experimentalists
- Communication with other CFD groups, who have relevant experience
** Reducing user errors
- Training of users
- Project discipline, both management and project engineer
- Specialised workshops
- Comparison of numerical results from different users
** Avoiding software errors
- Selection of high quality CFD software
- Compliance with software engineering and coding guidelines for new developments
- Testing of software with test suite by software developers (NASA tests)
- Testing of new version of CFD package for applications
