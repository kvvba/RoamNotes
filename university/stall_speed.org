#+title: Stall speed

* Definition
The slowest speed at which an aeroplane can fly is the stall speed, which is important for a safe take-off and landing.

* Formula
As [[id:84005369-0a9e-48a7-8c69-53bc4422377a][Lift]] is given by:

L = 0.5\rho U_\infin^2 AC_L

We know that L = W and C_L = C_Lmax just before aircraft stall, hence:

U_\infin = ((2W)/(\rho AC_Lmax))^{1/2}

Where W is weight, C_L is the [[id:12e0bef5-93ff-41f3-9ba2-22bb42b782a2][lift coefficient]], and A is the area of the lifting surface.

* Reducing stall speed
Reducing aircraft weight, increasing the lifting surface, or increasing C_Lmax will reduce the stall speed.
These are difficult to achieve once aircraft design is finalised.

[[id:1423bd92-09fc-4182-9227-72b60c0325e5][High-lift devices]] can be used to increase C_Lmax, individually or in combination.
