#+title: Fuel-air ratio

Use fuel-air ratio (FAR) charts to relate combustion inlet temperature, temperature rise across the combustory, and fuel-air ratio.

* Definitions
** FAR
Fuel-air ratio.
FAR = m'_f/m'_air
Where m'_f is fuel mass flow rate and m'_air is air mass flow rate.

** FHV
The fuel heating value. The amount of heat released during combustion of specified amount of fuel (1kg).
Typically given in MJ/kg.
