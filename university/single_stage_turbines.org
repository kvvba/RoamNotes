#+title: Single stage turbines

Used to drive multi stage compressors. Shrouded blades (see: [[id:dc6c0144-5ac7-4800-855a-842f80cf4aae][Turbine tip sealing]]).
- Large disc holds turbine blades
- Blades significantly more robust and heavier than compressor blades
- Turbine blades rotate at same speed as compressor blades
- This induces high centrifugal forces within disc
  - Requires large bore section to keep bore hoop stress within material limits
- Rotor blades fixed onto disc usually using fur tree roots
- Important to maintain good seals on top and in front of turbine to prevent gas bypassing the working section of the turbine, and to maximise efficiency
- Single stage turbine limited in amount of work it can do to maintain maximum efficiency, so they are limited to driving compression ratios in the order of 6-8:1
