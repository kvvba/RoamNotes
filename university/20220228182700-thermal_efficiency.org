#+title: Thermal efficiency

The efficiency of the engine core, where fuel is converted to supply useful kinetic energy.

* Calculation
Ratio of power needed for the jet and power available from the fuel.

\eta_th = (power to the jet)/(power available from fuel)

\eta_th = (0.5 m' (V_jet^2 - V_0^2))/(m_f' LCV)

Where LCV is the lower calorific value of the fuel, typically given in MJ/kg.
