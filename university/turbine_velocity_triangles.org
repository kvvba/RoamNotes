#+title: Turbine velocity triangles

* Nozzle guide vane
Exit velocity from nozzle guide vane is v_{1}\alpha_1
This can be resolved into tangential velocity v_{\omega1} and axial velocity v_a

Blade velocity is denoted U

Relative exit velocity from nozzle guide vane is v_r1
v_{1}\alpha_1 = v_r1 + U

* Turbine blade
Exit velocity from turbine blade is v_{2}\alpha_2
Can be resolved into tangential velocity v_\omega2 and axial velocity v_a
Relative exit velocity is v_r2
v_{2}\alpha_2 = v_r2 + U

* Reduction in whirl
v_\omega1 - v_\omega2

* Absolute flow angle
\alpha is the absolute flow angle relative to the axis. Angles positive in direction of rotation.

* Work
The work extracted and hence the reduction in enthalpy is given by the Euler work equation for unit mass

\Delta H = U(V_\omega1 - V_\omega2)
\Delta H = UV_a (tan \alpha_1 - tan \alpha_2)

Ideal \Delta t = U(V_\omega1 - V_\omega_2)/C_P

(T_2/T_1)^(\gamma/\gamma-1) = P_2/P_1
