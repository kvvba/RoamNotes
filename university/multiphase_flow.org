#+title: Multiphase flow

* Definition
A multiphase flow is any flow in which more than one phase is present:
- Gas-liquid flows
- Gas-solid flows
- Liquid-solid flows
- 3 phase equivalents

Also important to consider a liquid-liquid flow with two different liquids as a multiphase flow.

* Motivation
- Many practical engineering applications contain multiphase flow
  (see: [[id:8e5de456-5304-450f-88ca-455e0fbfa208][Industrial applications of multiphase CFD]])
- Interaction between phases changes flow physics

* Why use CFD?
- Often difficult, expensive, and time consuming to conduct experiments
- Often allows a range of parameters to be investigated
- Extra insight - looking inside complex components, take measurements which are not available experimentally
