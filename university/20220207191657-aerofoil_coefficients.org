#+title: Aerofoil coefficients

* Lift coefficient
C_L = (L)/(0.5\rho U^2_\infin A)
Where \rho is density and U_\infin is the freestream velocity.
A is the characteristic area.
* Drag coefficient
C_D = (D)/(0.5\rho U^2_\infin A)
Where D is the drag force.
* Pressure coefficient
C_p = (p-p_\infin)/(0.5\rho U^2_\infin)
Where p is static pressure (alternatively p_s) at point where C_p is evaluated, and p_\infin is static pressure in the freestream.
* Pitching moment coefficient
C_M = (M)/(0.5\rho U^2 Ac)
Where M is pitching moment and c is chord of the wing

* Reference wing area
** Wings
A = bc
Where b is wing span and c is chord length
** Bluff bodies
A = bD
Where b is length perpendicular to flow
And D is diameter
