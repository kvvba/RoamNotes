#+title: Wall function

Very fine meshes necessary to capture near-wall velocity gradient. This is not always possible in industrial setting. Therefore, wall functions are used, to solve the equations of the [[id:edb88f7a-ab59-41c7-a56a-fd8f4045aa1f][Law of the wall]].

u+ = (1/\kappa) ln(y+) + c
u = u_\tau [(1/\kappa) ln((u_\tau y)/\nu) + c]
Solve for friction velocity and hence obtain an "accurate" wall shear, by evaluating the first node in the turbulent portion of boundary layer.
This value of wall shear is used directly in turbulence models.

* 1/7th power law velocity distribution
A cruder turbulent velocity profile approximation takes the form:
u = U(y/\delta)^n
Where:
n = 1/7
\delta is boundary layer thickness
U is free-stream velocity

In fully developed pipe/channel flow:
U is maximum velocity
\delta is pipe radius or half channel width
