#+title: Convergent-divergent flow

* Flow through convergent-divergent nozzles
- As p_2 is lowered, velocity through the nozzle increases
- When p_2 is sufficiently low, Mach number at the throat will be 1
  - This is known as *choked flow*
- Further decrease of static pressure will not affect flow in converging section
- Mass flow rate is at a maximum when the flow is choked, for a given nozzle area

* Choked nozzle & expansion
- If p_exit > p_amb, the nozzle is *under expanded*
  - As flow could have expanded further
  - Expansion waves form at nozzle exit
- If p_exit > p_amb, the nozzle is *over expanded*
  - Shock waves form at the exit, typically in a diamond pattern
- *Maximum thrust at p_exit = p_amb&*
  - Flow just choked
- There is downstream expansion if the static pressure at nozzle throat is greater than p_amb

* Critical pressure ratio
From the equation of [[id:4bc4518b-9f85-4916-b6b6-de492344372f][Stagnation pressure]] in compressible flow:
(P)/(p) = (1 + M^2 \cdot (\gamma - 1)/(2))^(\gamma / (\gamma -1))

Choked at Ma = 1, hence:
(P)/(p) = (1 + (\gamma - 1)/(2))^(\gamma / (\gamma -1))
Which gives the critical pressure ration P/p.

Pressure ratios lower than the critical pressure ratio indicate unchoked flow. Conversely, pressure ratios higher than the critical pressure ratio indicate choked flow. When the ratio is equal to the critical ratio, this flow is just choked.
