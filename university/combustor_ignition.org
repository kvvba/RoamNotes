#+title: Combustor ignition

The ignition characteristics are influenced by physical features as well as thermodynamic conditions:
- Igniter immersion
- Spark rate
- Spark energy
- Fuel cone dimensions and pattern
- Fuel atomisation
Ignition can vary with aircraft speed and altitude - high power is required for relight at high altitudes and is sometimes needed for starting. Typical power of 2J over 1 microsecond (2MW).
Under certain flight conditions, for example descending in rain at flight idle, it may be necessary to have constant ignition to prevent a flameout. For these conditions, a lower power output is preferred to give a longer igniter life.
