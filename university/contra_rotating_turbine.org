#+title: Contra-rotating turbine

As opposed to [[id:3a030663-0ab3-4cf9-9a27-ec4b03fa845a][Co-rotating turbine]].

- Air passage is much straighter
- Air is directed in correct direction for second turbine blade
- More efficient second turbine
  - Fewer NGV required to turn
  - Less aerodynamic secondary loss
  - Lighter, lower cost arrangement
- Nozzle guide vanes (see: [[id:cba2f7e3-cffd-4041-a82e-0f66bc3fcef9][Turbine operation]]) of contra-rotating turbine between turbine stages are thinner
- NGV do less turning
  - Gas turning reduced by around 40\deg
  - Hence more efficient, lighter, lower cost
