#+title: Mesh independence
[[id:bd467448-61c5-4dfb-bdbb-2ea516628a0f][Mesh]] independence is the process whereby the user ensures that the
solution that is obtained does not vary as a function of the mesh size,
or that it varies only slightly. This is to guarantee that the solution is
not determined, at least partly, by the discretisation. A well designed
mesh will offer a finer mesh in region of strong gradients so that the
discrete solution can be accounted for in a piece-wise linear form.
Typically a mesh will be ‘doubled’ up in each direction to assess the
influence upon the CFD solution.
