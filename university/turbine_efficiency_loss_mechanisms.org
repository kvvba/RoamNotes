#+title: Turbine efficiency loss mechanisms

Losses in [[id:102568d2-a06b-416f-9037-1ce6c86164db][Turbine efficiency]].

* Flow phenomena
- Overtip leakage, flow bypasses the working section
- Combustion temperature profile from root to tip, the traverse, should be as uniform as possible
  - Usable turbine entry temperature is determined by the traverse temperature
  - Poor traverse can cause loss of power and efficiency
- Mixing of cooling air in the gas path, disturbing main gas flow
- Secondary flow from nozzle guide vane and HP turbine blade
- Amount of cooling air for the blade and vane
