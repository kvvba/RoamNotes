#+title: Combustor requirements

- Low pressure loss (SFC, turbine cooling, HPC surge)
- Emissions for ICAO compliance and competition
- High temperature capability over 2100K
- Transient performance (5 sec acceleration)
- Altitude restart up to 30000-35000 ft
- Life ~40000 hours without repair
- Minimum cost, weight, and length
- Ground start to -40\deg C
- Weak stability to ~250 AFR combustor exist (+ water/hail)
- Exit temperature traverse to suit the turbine
- Rumble free (pressure instability)
- Carbon shedding free (to prevent turbine erosion)
