#+title: Turbulent velocity fluctuations

Fluid velocity can be decomposed into mean (u bar) and fluctuating (u') components.

Instantaneous velocities:
u = \oline{u} + u'
v = \oline{v} + v'
w = \oline{w} + w'

Time averaging u, v, w at a point gives \oline{u}, \oline{v}, \oline{w}

Velocity fluctuations u', v', w' are caused by [[id:6cb2f926-6c0f-4f85-97f6-683e49cedc4e][Vortices]]. The largest vortices produce the greatest difference in u', v', w'.

In smaller vortices, viscous damping makes the turbulence mode isotropic (u' = v' = w').

Local eddy speed is approximately the RMS of the velocity fluctuations.
U_eddy = (\oline{u'^2})^{0.5}
[[id:a29c4f89-fd8b-46b2-863b-5cc2cd01851a][Reynolds number]] of the turbulence can be calculated using U_eddy.
