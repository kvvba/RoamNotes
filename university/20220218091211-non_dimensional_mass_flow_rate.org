#+title: Non-dimensional mass flow rate

Mass flow rate per unit area

m\oline = (m'_air (c_p T)^0.5)/(AP)

Where m\oline represents m bar, the ND mass flow rate
m'_air is the mass flow rate (m dot) of air
c_p is the specfic heat at constant pressure
T is the stagnation temperature
P is the stagnation pressure (also known as total pressure)
