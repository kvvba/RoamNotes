#+title: Steady and unsteady flow

CFD simulations can be run as steady or unsteady (transient). It is common to solve the same set of 'unsteady' equations for both, the [[id:917a4eb2-c4c0-4bbf-83d8-ed65ccef18f2][Navier-Stokes equations]].

* Steady
- Steady simulations are cheaper, i.e. quicker to run
- Steady flow simulations ignore time dependency
  (common to apply to flows which are unsteady in reality)
- Calculate using a large timestep

* Unsteady
- Unsteady simulations require you to run them over a period of time
- Unsteady flow simulations tend to be more accurate as steady ignores time dependency
- Calculate using a small timestep to capture time-dependent behaviour

Common to send everything to the right-hand-side of the equation apart from time derivative.
e.g. for [[id:917a4eb2-c4c0-4bbf-83d8-ed65ccef18f2][Navier-Stokes equations]]: (\partial\rho u)/(\partial t) = RHS
e.g. for unsteady heat conduction eq: (\partial T)/(\partial t) = (\partial^2 T)/(\partial x^2) - S = RHS

For solving [[id:9144ea7d-bb69-4755-99f5-ceeffe2bb21f][unsteady flow]] can use a forwards [[id:7b412b3c-ecce-47ff-a186-ef2fb10cf387][Finite difference]] to [[id:a1b71fda-3289-4304-9ee1-46c274781c76][Discretize]] the time derivative.
This is [[id:d20c1d12-c5cb-4518-8446-8b7bd9fedd1c][Temporal discretization]].
(\partial T)/(\partial t) = RHS
(\partial T)/(\partial t) = (T_i^(n+1) - T_i^(n))/(\Delta t)
