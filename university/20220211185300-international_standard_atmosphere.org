#+title: International standard atmosphere

Pressure (p), density (\rho), and temperature (T) are dependant on altitude.

* Layers of atmosphere
- Large boundary layer near ground
  - Can be kilometres high
- Troposphere: < 11km (36089 ft)
  - Temperature varies linearly
- Tropopause: 11km
  - Represents approximate flight ceiling for aircraft
- Stratosphere: > 11km, < 20km (65617 ft)
  - Temperature fairly constant
  - -56.5\deg C

* Sea level conditions
- Temperature (T_sl) = 288.15K
- Pressure (p_sl) = 101.3kPa
- Density (\rho_sl) = 1.225 kg/m^3
  sl - sea level

* Pressure at altitude
Use ISA table or the formula:

P_H = p_sl [1 - ((kH)/(T_sl))]^((g/RK))

Where H is the altitude, k is the rate of change of temperature with height, and R is the gas constant.
The ICAO defines k as 6.5 Kelvin per 1000m up to the troposphere.
k = 6.5e-3 K/m

Note:
Pressure and temperature decrease linearly with height.
p = p_sl - \rho gH
T = T_sl - kH

* ISA table corrections
ISA+X indicates temperature correction of X Kelvin
