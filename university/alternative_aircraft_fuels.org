#+title: Alternative aircraft fuels

- Many options have been reviewed:
  - Bio-diesel
  - Fischer-Tropsch kerosene
  - Bio-methane
  - Alcohols
  - Nuclear
  - LH2 (liquid hydrogen)
    
- Rejected options:
  - Alcohol extenders
    - Safety (flash point and toxicity)
    - Energy density
    - Emissions
  - Methane
    - Quality/quantity of supply
  - Nuclear
    - Safety
      
- Potential options under active study:
  - Fischer-Tropsch kerosene
    - Converting CO and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons
    - CO and hydrogen produced from coal, natural gas, or biomass in gasification
    - Fischer-Tropsch process converts these into synthetic lubricant and fuel
  - Bio-fuels
    - Demanding on land use, conflicts with food production
