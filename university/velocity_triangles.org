#+title: Velocity triangles

Check lecture notes for illustrations.
Used in conjunction with [[id:30ca5371-baad-4d97-b4f6-d783dc13c9d4][Euler turbomachinery equation]].
Inlet and outlet angles of the blade are generally not the same as the angles of the flow (see: [[id:ecfd3220-8199-494e-9f8b-8c4ee915b376][Incidence and deviation]]).

Steps to draw velocity triangles:
1. Draw the flow that you know
2. Draw the blade speed
3. Close the triangle
4. Check that the key rule applies:
   v_abs = u + w_rel

* Angles
\alpha - absolute flow angle, angle between absolute flow velocity v_abs and axis
\beta - relative flow angle, angle between relative flow velocity w_rel and axis

Angles are positive in the direction of rotation.

* Trig relationships
From basic trigonometry the following relationships apply for any station in a turbomachine:
V^2 = V_\theta^2 + V_x^2
V_x = V cos\alpha
V_\theta = V sin\alpha
V_\theta = V_x tan\alpha

W^2 = W_\theta^2 + W_x^2
W_x = W cos\beta
W_\theta = W sin\beta
W_\theta = W_x tan\beta
