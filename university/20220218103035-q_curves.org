#+title: Q curves

Also known as "compressible flow curves".

Q curves apply to flow in any duct of varying area with no work or heat transfer.

Q curves plot [[id:0e42ba60-18fc-4f17-a227-cf7cab76ca51][Mach number]] against Q, VT^-0.5, T/t, and P/p. (See: [[id:97f627c6-3416-4b65-96a8-9c409dc44317][Quasi/semi non-dimensional numbers]]).

* Notes
- The y-axis minimum of a Q curve chart is 1, not 0
- Each curve has its own scale
- Different Q curves exist for different gamma values, \gamma
- Can be used to obtain key flow parameters
