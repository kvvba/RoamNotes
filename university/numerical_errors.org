#+title: Numerical errors

- Discretisation errors
  - (also see: [[id:a1b71fda-3289-4304-9ee1-46c274781c76][Discretization techniques]])
  - Difference between the exact and numerical (discretised) solution
    E = (\Sigma|\phi_exact - \phi_numeric|)/(\Sigma|\phi_exact|)
  - Discretisation error can be quantified/reduced by [[id:a52e293f-ac9a-4e2f-92d9-eaf0e3b87efe][Richardson extrapolation]]
- Convergence errors
  - (also see: [[id:01642bd1-dc9b-409c-8c2c-629d360f1711][Stability improvement and convergence acceleration for steady flows]])
  - Difference between the exact and iterative solutions of discretised equations
- Round off errors
  - Computers can hold numbers only to finite number of significant figures

* Truncation errors (see: [[id:9dc87607-4812-4d90-b9a4-047dd32f15d4][Modified equation analysis]])
- Dispersion error
  - Causes fluctuations to occur in the solution, as well as phase errors
  - Pure [[id:077ef527-d71a-469e-b74e-43d565737784][Central difference]] schemes will give rise to dispersion errors
  - Reduced by using more diffusive schemes such as [[id:0023b56a-2aaf-4155-85c3-e14076f7a59c][Upwinding]]
- Diffusion error
  - Will help suppress dispersion errors and hence is good for stability
  - However will damp out flow unsteadiness and smooth out gradients in variables
  - Disadvantageous for unsteady simulations and especially eddy resolving simulations
  - Numerical diffusion errors minimized by using higher order schemes

Minimise these errors with [[id:c00c1817-43ae-4a7a-a044-bdee4901b95f][Error verification]].
