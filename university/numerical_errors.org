#+title: Numerical errors

- Discretisation errors
  - (also see: [[id:a1b71fda-3289-4304-9ee1-46c274781c76][Discretization techniques]])
  - Difference between the exact and numerical (discretised) solution
- Convergence errors
  - (also see: [[id:01642bd1-dc9b-409c-8c2c-629d360f1711][Stability improvement and convergence acceleration for steady flows]])
  - Difference between the exact and iterative solutions of discretised equations
- Round off errors
  - Computers can hold numbers only to finite number of significant figures
