#+title: Turbulence basics

* Turbulence is ..
- Random, 3D, time dependent eddying motion with many scales
- The natural state at high [[id:a29c4f89-fd8b-46b2-863b-5cc2cd01851a][Reynolds number]]s
- An efficient transporter and mixer
- A major source of energy loss
- A significant influence on drag
- Transported by the flow
- Produced due to velocity gradients in the mean flow
- Dissipated by viscosity (see: [[id:6cb2f926-6c0f-4f85-97f6-683e49cedc4e][Vortices]])
- Re-distributed by pressure fluctuations

* Laminar vs turbulent flow
Laminar flow:
- Smooth
- No mixing of fluid
- Momentum transfer by viscous forces
- Thicker boundary layers
	
Turbulent flow:
- Chaotic
- Mixing of fluid
- Momentum transfer mainly by net effect of intermingling
- Thinner boundary layers

Regime is determined by [[id:a29c4f89-fd8b-46b2-863b-5cc2cd01851a][Reynolds number]].
"Low" Re => laminar flow
"High" Re => turbulent flow
