#+title: Mixing length model

The mixing length model is a zero equation [[id:341e55e9-c2df-4daf-a31e-fac9337e1638][Eddy viscosity model]].

Mixing length is the maximum length that a fluid "packet" can travel vertically without interaction, i.e. momentum is conversed over a distance l.

Fluid packet is transported from y to y+l by [[id:14e9937f-54c1-49ca-8a4f-d6536dcd26c5][Turbulent velocity fluctuation]] v'.
It carries the momentum at y to y+l.

The result is a fluctuation in x velocity as:
\oline{u'} \approx \oline{u}(y) - \oline{u}(y+l) = -l((d\oline{u})/(dy))

We also assume \oline{v'}=\oline{u'} and hence [[id:e43e1cea-99a7-47c1-99c1-5741791b2461][Reynolds stress]] is:
\rho\oline{u'v'} = -\rho l^2 ((d\oline{u})/(dy))^2

Hence
-\rho\oline{u'v'} = \mu_T ((d\oline{u})/(dy)) = \rho l^2 ((d\oline{u})/dy)^2

And so:
\mu_T = \rho l^2 ((d\oline{u})/dy)

* Measured mixing lengths
Mixing length l_m proportional to width of layer \delta
** Mixing layer
l_m = 0.071\delta
** Jet
l_m = 0.098\delta (plane)
l_m = 0.080\delta (round)
** Wake
l_m = 0.180\delta

* Near-wall region
l = \kappa y
Where y is the distance from the wall and \kappa is the von Karman constant
\kappa = 0.4

The dominant shear stress at the wall will be due to turbulent shear:
\tau_w = \mu_T ((du)/(dy))

Hence:
u = (1/\kappa) \cdot (\tau_w/\rho)^0.5 ln(y) + c
Giving log law velocity distribution. This equation holds well except very near the wall in the laminar sub layer where viscous forces dominate. In the laminar sub-layer the velocity distribution is linear, as with Couette flow.
