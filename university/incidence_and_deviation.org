#+title: Incidence and deviation

In relation to [[id:990ea0cc-711e-4b8f-8739-5bdacd80ffa6][Velocity triangles]].

Incidence = flow angle inlet - metal angle inlet
Deviation = flow angle outlet - metal angle outlet

Where both flow and metal angles are relative to the axis.
Metal angle is the physical angle of the inlet/outlet of the blade.

Ideally the deviation would be zero but in reality this is generally not the case.
