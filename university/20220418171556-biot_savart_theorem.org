#+title: Biot-Savart theorem

The Biot-Savart theorem for finite vortex filaments describes a magnetic field generated by constant electrical current. However it can also be applied in the problem of aerodynamic [[id:626f17bb-0f09-4335-81ef-03cfd2f4eb87][Trailing vortices]].

To identify the velocity induced by the vortex with end points A and B at a point P, draw straight lines from A and B to P. Identify the angles \alpha and \beta between each line AP and AB and the vortex (the line AB). The velocity from the vortex is 90 degreen to this plane, and give as:

v = ((\Gamma)/(4\pi h)) * (cos\alpha + cos\beta)
Where h is the perpendicular distance from the point P to the vortex line AB.
