#+title: Finite difference scheme accuracy

- Higher order [[id:7b412b3c-ecce-47ff-a186-ef2fb10cf387][Finite differences]] schemes are less dissipative
  - Hence more unstable
  - Hence better for eddy resolving methods
    - Turbulence is not damped out
  - More prone to dispersion errors, some diffusive scheme is required e.g. [[id:0023b56a-2aaf-4155-85c3-e14076f7a59c][Upwinding]]
- Higher order schemes need larger number of points, having a greater stencil size
  - More data stored
  - More computationally expensive
- Treatment of boundary conditions can be a challenge with higher order schemes
- Partitioning meshes for parallel computation more difficult with higher order schemes
  - More data needs to be sent across boundaries
  - Reduces parallel scalability
