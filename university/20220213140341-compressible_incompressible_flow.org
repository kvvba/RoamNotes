#+title: Compressible & incompressible flow

Important for considering flow through bypass ducts and nozzles.

* Incompressible flows
Incompressible flows have a constant density.
Typically has a [[id:0e42ba60-18fc-4f17-a227-cf7cab76ca51][Mach number]] less than 0.3. Compressibility effects do not need to be considered in analysis.

* Compressible flows
Compressible flows have a variable density.
Flow is considered compressible when [[id:0e42ba60-18fc-4f17-a227-cf7cab76ca51][Mach number]] is above 0.3.
