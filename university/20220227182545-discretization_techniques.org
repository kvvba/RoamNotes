#+title: Discretization techniques

The flow can be solved at discrete points by replacing partial derivatives of the [[id:917a4eb2-c4c0-4bbf-83d8-ed65ccef18f2][Navier-Stokes equations]] with approximate algebraic quotients, turning them into a system of algebraic equations. These will be solved for the values of flow-field at discrete grid points.
