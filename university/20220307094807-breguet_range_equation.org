#+title: Breguet range equation

Takes into account change of weight of aircraft due to fuel use, using [[id:da543acc-5803-4881-bb4e-b475f69a38d8][Specific fuel consumption]].

sfc = (fuel mass flow rate)/([[id:6e7e33eb-420b-4517-8993-5d24babea27c][net thrust]])

dm/dt = - (sfc \times F_N)
Hence
dw/dt = -g (sfc \times F_N)

Re-arranging and noting that v = dx/dt hence dt = dx/v

dx = -(vL/D)/(g \times sfc) \cdot dw/w

Integrate between start and end weight to obtain range.

* Range equation
Range = - (vL/D)/(g \times sfc) \cdot ln(w_end/w_start)

Where v is velocity, L/D is lift to drag ratio, g is acceleration due to gravity, sfc is [[id:da543acc-5803-4881-bb4e-b475f69a38d8][Specific fuel consumption]], and w_end and w_start are end and start weight respectively.
