#+title: Combustion loading

* Residence time
The time spent in the combustion process. It is a function of the volume of the combustor divided by mass flow rate.
* Reaction time
The time taken for the combustion process to take place. It is an inverse function of static pressure and total temperature.
* Combustion loading factor, \Lambda
A function of residence time and reaction time.

Combustion loading factor = (Reaction time)/(Residence time)

\Lambda = W / (VP_31^1.8 \cdot 10^(0.00145 (T_31 - 400)))
Where station 31 is the combustion inlet.
