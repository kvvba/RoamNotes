#+title: Turbine material selection

- Proof strength
  - Margin for random failure
  - Damage tolerance
  - Does not cover vibration (HCF, high cycle fatigue)
- Creep strength
  - 100 hour creep life gives margin for service deterioration
- Oxidation limit
  - Due to exposure to oxygen at elevated temperatures
