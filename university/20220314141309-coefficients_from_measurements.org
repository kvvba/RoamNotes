* Coefficient of pressure
1. Measure p from tappings
2. Measure U_\infin , p_\infin
3. Calculate from formula
4. Plot C_P curves for top/bottom wing surfaces

* Coefficient of lift
1. Divide surface into small linear pieces (ds)
2. Force due to pressure is (p-p_\infin)ds
3. Find vertical component
4. Integrate vertical components over both surfaces

* Coefficient of drag
1. Divide surface into small linear pieces (ds)
2. Force due to pressure is (p-p_\infin)ds
3. Find horizontal component
4. Integrate horizontal components over both surfaces

* Moment coefficient
1. Find quarter chord point along chord line
2. Find moment arm r
3. Find force dF = (p-p_\infin)ds
4. Integrate dF \times r over the wing
5. Form moment coefficient
