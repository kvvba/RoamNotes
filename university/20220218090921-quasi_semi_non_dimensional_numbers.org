#+title: Quasi/semi non-dimensional numbers

A non-dimensional number formed by [[id:da9febf0-bb76-41ca-91ba-956019158218][Dimensional analysis]] from which a variable has been dropped for convenience. This gives it dimension.

* Q
Q is the quasi non-dimensional mass flow rate. To form Q, c_p is dropped from the [[id:c32353cd-f895-4369-be98-658ff8b86af3][Non-dimensional mass flow rate]] equation.

Units of kgK^-0.5/sm^2 Pa.
Typically given in kPa, kgK^-0.5/sm^2 kPa

Q = (m'_air T^0.5)/(AP)
Where Q is quasi non-dimensional mass flow rate - kgK^-0.5/sm^2 Pa
T is stagnation temperature
A is area
P is stagnation pressure (also known as total pressure)

* Velocity in a duct

VT^-0.5

Where V is velocity and T is stagnation temperature.
