#+title: Eulerian-Mixture (Algebraic Slip Model (ASM))

An Eulerian [[id:d2c3d66b-ecdc-45dc-8ba2-323bb1a9cf94][Multiphase flow modelling]] technique. The Mixture/ASM model allows two phases to be interpenetrating.

- Both fluids share a single set of momentum and continuity equations
- [[id:7293783c-3bd1-4117-81bf-1aebc764ff58][Volume fraction]] equation is solved for secondary phase
- Phases can move at different velocities due to the inclusion of an algebraic expression for relative velocities of phases
- Valid for low [[id:7293783c-3bd1-4117-81bf-1aebc764ff58][Volume fraction]] flows
- Applications such as bubble flows
