#+title: Delta wings

* Characteristics
- The swept-back wing reduces the effective [[id:0e42ba60-18fc-4f17-a227-cf7cab76ca51][Mach number]] in high-speed flight
- Wave drag reduced at supersonic speeds
- [[id:84005369-0a9e-48a7-8c69-53bc4422377a][Lift]] to drag ratio reduced at subsonic speeds
- Delta wings have no 2D chord
- Flow separates at the sharp leading edge
- Leads to roll-up of vortices
  - These look similar to [[id:626f17bb-0f09-4335-81ef-03cfd2f4eb87][trailing vortices]]
- Vortices above wing due to wing shape
  - Low pressure above wing => lift

** Delta wing stall
- Large stall angle (~35\deg)
  - Delta wing planes land at high angle of attack
- Delta wings are sensitive to leading-edge stall due to sharp form
  - Could improve this by adding a leading-edge [[id:bfc20280-a02c-4607-9b3a-11994dfd52b0][slat]]
  - Can also passively improve it by rounding edges
    - Rounded leading edge also increases [[id:84005369-0a9e-48a7-8c69-53bc4422377a][lift]] to drag ratio
- Stall can occur because of vortex breakdown instability
  - As all lift comes from the two roll-up vortices

* Types of delta wings
- Simple delta
- Cropped delta
- Notched delta
- Double delta
