#+title: Modelling errors

- Time averaging of equations
  - (see also: [[id:ca2a74bf-52f8-4b77-a304-5cbe431143d5][RANS model]])
  - Resolution reduced, information lost
  - Information introduced from outside (e.g. [[id:e43e1cea-99a7-47c1-99c1-5741791b2461][Reynolds stress]])
- Physical phenomena not full represented
  - (see also: [[id:c69e13c0-095c-4ca7-ab97-73aecd403f17][Turbulent flow modelling approaches]])
  - Turbulence contains many different scales
  - Not resolving all scales in turbulence models
  - Not able to model chemical reactions, e.g. in combustion
- Turbulence model and selecting
  - No a priori criterion
  - Expertise and knowledge of the CFD user

Minimise modelling errors with [[id:52fd31c0-c0e5-440b-8c3c-9c2a7aded285][Error validation]].
