#+title: Vortices

The maximum size of vortices is related to the flow system size.
In a pipe flow, the largest eddy is the diameter of the pipe.

Energy cascade passes turbulent kinetic energy through progressively smaller vortex structures.

The length scale of the smallest vortex is such that Re \approx 1.
As viscous and inertial forces are equal when Re = 1, these smaller vortices are quickly destroyed - dissipating turbulent kinetic energy into heat.

To solve for smallest turbulence scale, mesh will need to have 3 mesh points across smallest eddy.
