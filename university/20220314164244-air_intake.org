#+title: Air intake

Functions:
- Capture inlet air and present it in acceptable state to compression system
- Provide noise attenuation
These functions are to be achieved over the entire flight regime:
- With low distortion (non-uniformity)
- Low internal losses
- Low external drag

Intakes are often the responsibility of the airframer, but in consultation with the engine manufacturer.
Usually engine manufacturer takes responsibility for the inner lines and the airframer for the external lines.

Type main types of intakes: subsonic and supersonic.

* Subsonic intakes
- The entry speed to the fan or first stage of compression is of order to 0.4-0.6 [[id:0e42ba60-18fc-4f17-a227-cf7cab76ca51][Mach number]]
- Total pressure loss in the diffuser in the order of 0.5%
- Cruise and climb
  - High forward and speed and high power, the inlet is choked
  - The air entering the inlet is diffused to reduce the [[id:0e42ba60-18fc-4f17-a227-cf7cab76ca51][Mach number]]
  - The excess air spills and crates spillage drag which is alleviated by a well-designed external profile
- Take-off
  - Low forward speed and high power
  - Ground effect and cross wind impact inlet profile

** Subsonic intake construction
Components:
- Rounded lipskin (Ti)
- Forward bulkhead
- Thermal anti-icing manifold (can be electrically de-icing on smaller intakes)
- Outer skin (CFC)
- Rear fireproof bulkhead (Ti)
- Thermal anti-icing feed pipe
- P1 probe
- Noise attenuating barrel (composite)
- Attaching flang (Al)

** Intake distortion
- Intake distortion is detrimental to engine and aircraft performance and can be initiated:
  - External to the intake on the nacelle (crosswind, ground effect)
  - High incidence climb
  - Within the diffuser internal surface
- Separation on the outer surface would lead to increase in overall drag of the aircraft
- Separation within the diffuser geometry would result in:
  - Higher pressure losses (loss of thrust)
  - Increased fan blade fatigue stress

*** Intake ground effect modelling
Modern CFD capability eliminates a great deal of physical testing which requires:
- Larger corss wind blowers
- Distortion generating screens
  
*** Intake distortion testing
- Engine tests is required can be done with a sepcial grid in the intake to create air inlet distortion
- Distortion is measured by a coefficient and is the measure of the intake exit flow non-uniformity
- There are several classifications for distortion coefficient
DC_\theta = (P_2 - P_(2\theta min))/(P_1)
- The sector angle that is most commonly used is 60\deg and therefore the distortion coefficient is DC60
- P_1 is inlet entry, P_2 fan face pressure

* Supersonic intakes
- The function of a supersonic intake is the same as a subsonic but obviously operates over a greater speed range
- Supersonic intakes consist of two segments:
  - Supersonic diffuser where the flow is decelerated from supersonic to subsonic through a series of shocks
  - This is followed by a subsonic diffuser where the flow is decelerated from hgih subsonic to lower subsonic speeds
- Supersonic intake design is more demanding
  - Shock waves cause significant loss in total pressure
  - There is a large variation in the capture area between subsonic and supersonic flight
  - With higher [[id:0e42ba60-18fc-4f17-a227-cf7cab76ca51][Mach number]] the inlet compression ratio is a larger fraction of overall pressure ratio
    - Thrust becomes more sensitive to diffuser performance
  - The intake has to have high efficiency in both subsonic and supersonic flight regimes
- Supersonic intakes may be classified in the following ways:
  - Axi-symmetric:
    - Central cone for shock fixture
    - Variable or fixed central cone
  - Two-dimensional:
    - Rectangular cross-section
    - Variable or fixed geometry (one of the walls may be adjustable)
