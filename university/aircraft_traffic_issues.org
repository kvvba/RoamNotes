#+title: Aircraft traffic issues

* Environmental
- ICAO set global minimum standards but regional concerns vary
- Global: Climate change (and fuel use)
- Local: Air quality (NOx and particulates), noise
- By region:
  - Europe: global and local concerns
  - North America: predominantly local concerns
  - Rest of world: environment generally not a key issue, with a few exceptions, but it is growing
- Most pollutants emitted in upper atmosphere, understanding of effects immature
  - Consensus is that contrails do have impact

* Congestion
- More flights need more and larger airports to accommodate the increase in passengers and flight movements
- These are often build on the outskirts of cities with large infrastructure required to transport passengers to city centres
- Pressure on land use and environmental concerns

* Airline affordability
- As new environmentally-friendly aircraft are developed, airlines need funds to buy them
- These must come from the profits they make
- Airline profitability highly fluid
