#+title: CFD conventions

* Inflow and outflow
- Inflow defined as negative mass flow rate
- Outflow defined as positive mass flow rate

* Control volumes
- Horizontal flow:
  - x is the horizontal axis, positive to the right
  - u is the horizontal component of fluid velocity
  - Control volumes have thickness \Delta x in the x direction
- Vertical flow:
  - y is the vertical axis, positive upwards
  - v is the vertical component of fluid velocity
  - Control volumes have thickness \Delta y in the y direction
- Faces
  - l, r, b, t represent the left, right, bottom, and top faces respectively

* 2D simulation
- Assume unit depth of control volumes
