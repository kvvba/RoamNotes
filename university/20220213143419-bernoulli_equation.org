#+title: Bernoulli equation

p_1 + \rho gh_1 + (1/2)\rho_1 v_1^2 = p_2 + \rho gh_2 + (1/2)\rho_2 v_2^2

or

p + \rho gh + (1/2)\rho v^2 = p_t
Where p_t is total pressure.

p_1 + (1/2)\rho_1 v_1^2 = p_2 + (1/2)\rho_2 v_2^2
For no change in potential energy.

Where p is static pressure, and (1/2)\rho v is the dynamic pressure.
p + (1/2)\rho v^2 is the [[id:4bc4518b-9f85-4916-b6b6-de492344372f][Stagnation pressure]], denoted P or p_0.

Assuming no work or heat transfer into or out of the system.

* Pitot tube
v^2 = (2/\rho) * (p_p - p_\infin)
Where p_p is Pitot tube total pressure (alteratively p_t)
And p_\infin is atmospheric static pressure (alternatively p_s)

* Notes
- Bernoulli equation is not valid for compressible flows, must not be used in compressible flow regions in gas turbine engines
- Most areas of gas turbine engines involve compressible flow and so it is generally not used
