#+title: HPC basics

Super computers (highly parallel computers) allow us to model complete systems in detail. They split the computational work across many "tasks" or "processes".
Typically there will be 1 task per processor. A complete mesh will be split up between tasks/processors.

If processors have multiple cores, individual mesh regions will be assinged to those cores. The speed of data transfer between mesh regions is important, and data transfer between cores is much faster than between processors (and is hence preferable).
