For definitions of choked and unchoked flow, see [[id:83203801-5c4e-4923-a8be-591387858834][Convergent-divergent flow]].

* Unchoked nozzle
** Net thrust
F_N = (m'_air + m'_f)V_jet - m'_air V_0
Where m'_f is mass flow rate of fuel. Typically insignificant and ignored.

Can be defined in terms of gross thrust and ram drag.
F_N = F_G -m'_air V_0

** Gross thrust
If the aircraft is stationary, the thrust produced is known as the gross thrust.

F_G = (m'_air + m'_f)V_jet

** Ram drag
The ram drag is defined as m'_air V_0

* Choked nozzle
** Net thrust
F_N = m'V_jet - m'V_0 + A_N(p_N -p_amb)
Where A_N of the nozzle throat, p_N is static pressure at nozzle throat, and p_amb is static pressure downstream of nozzle (typically atmospheric).

** Gross thrust
If the aircraft is stationary, the gross thrust is:

F_G = m'V_jet + A_N(p_N - p_amb)
