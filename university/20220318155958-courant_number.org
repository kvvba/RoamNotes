#+title: Courant number

* Formula
C = (u \Delta t)/(\Delta x)

* Description
High Courant number causes an unstable scheme, and conversely a low Courant number creates a stable scheme.
As mesh is refined or Reynolds number increases, C increases, and therefore a smaller time step is needed.
Courant number is a local quantity and can be evaluated at every mesh point, and should generally be kept at a value of 1.

When running unsteady calculations it's good practice to contour the Courant number. This can be used to help decide a time step for a flow solution.

* Physical significance
A Courant number of 1 implies that a fluid particle moves one grid point per timestep, a Courant number of 2 implies a fluid particle moves two grid points per time step, and so on.
Hence a Courant number C>1 implies that the mesh is being wasted.
