#+title: Sub-grid-scale models (SGS models)

SGS models are used to model the sub-grid-scale stresses which represent the smallest size eddies in [[id:ed6d4951-4845-4989-8415-824d8bca1d10][Large eddy simulation (LES)]].

There are many SGS models.

* The Smagorinsky model
A function of filter width.

SGS Stress = -2(C_s \Delta)^2|\oline{S}|S_ij
Smagorinsky constant C_s ~ 0.2
\Delta = filter width (usually mesh cell size)
S = strain tensor
