#+title: Smith/Swindell chart

Efficiency as a function of work coefficient (\Delta H/U^2) and flow coefficient (V_a/U).
(see: [[id:8686fa8a-b99f-4d46-a1be-d447529fd8f0][Turbine velocity triangles]])

Smith/Swindell chart shows efficiency curves as a relation of these two. Increasing efficiency toward the origin.

High efficiency achieved by:
- Low work per stage
- Low V_a/U flow coefficient
- High rotor speed U improves both of these
