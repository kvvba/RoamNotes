#+title: Stagnation pressure

Denoted either by p_o or P.

Can be calculated for both [[id:b66fcf27-d26b-4e44-a1c4-fe3a6e777509][Compressible & incompressible flow]].

Stagnation pressure is analagous to [[id:e1eae400-70c7-4e53-83a8-ad642e35553d][Stagnation temperature]].

* Incompressible flow
Pressure experienced when flow comes to a standstill, a stagnation point.

P = p + (1/2)\rho v^2 + h_g
Where p is the static pressure.

[[id:2aaabf68-4c99-46dd-8358-73edb77da674][Bernoulli equation]] states P_1 = P_2 if no heat or work is exchanged with surroundings.

* Compressible flow
State attained by the fluid when it is decelerate to zero speed in a loss-free manner.
For ideal (loss-free) process:

(P)/(p) = (1 + M^2 \cdot (\gamma - 1)/(2))^(\gamma / (\gamma -1))

Where M is [[id:0e42ba60-18fc-4f17-a227-cf7cab76ca51][Mach number]], and p is static pressure.
