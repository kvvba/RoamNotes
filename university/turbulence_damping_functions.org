#+title: Turbulence damping functions

Some turbulence models require near-wall damping functions to produce accurate near-wall solutions.

The standard [[id:8ac1d8d9-9fad-42a0-ac17-ef6ea006599f][k-epsilon model]] will only produce accurate near wall solutions if damping functions are included.

Standard definition of [[id:341e55e9-c2df-4daf-a31e-fac9337e1638][Eddy viscosity]] in the [[id:8ac1d8d9-9fad-42a0-ac17-ef6ea006599f][k-epsilon model]]:
\mu_T = \rho C_\mu (k^2/\epsilon)

Modified close to the wall by the damping function f_\mu

f_\mu = (-3.4)/[(1+(R_t/50))^2]

Note the extra terms are also included in the epsilon equations. Note also that there are many different variants.
