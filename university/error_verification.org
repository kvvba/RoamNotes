#+title: Error verification

Minimise [[id:e68eade6-677d-43ec-960e-dac6286511d4][Numerical errors]] by comparison to analytical solution.

- Define target values
- Examine mesh density
- Examine scheme order
- Examine residual cut-off
- Examine time-step (if unsteady)

* Avoiding numerical errors
** Grid refinement study
- Generate 3 grids for each application
- Start with coarsest grid sufficient to resolve relevant details
- Next mesh halves mesh spacings
- Solution eventually becomes independent of the mesh
- See: [[id:20e08c09-6934-401e-8f27-3375b09b314c][Mesh independence]]
** Spatial discretisation
- The order of discretisation schemes may also be varied to assess error
- It may be possible to run on coarser meshes with higher-order schemes
- However, higher order schemes are more expensive and require more storage
- See: [[id:a1b71fda-3289-4304-9ee1-46c274781c76][Discretization techniques]]
** Temporal discretisation
- At least second order is recommended for time discretisation
- Time discretisation errors can be reduced by smaller time steps
- For a given numerical scheme, the solution should be computed with different time steps (at least 3) and the target variables should be reported
- See: [[id:d20c1d12-c5cb-4518-8446-8b7bd9fedd1c][Temporal discretization]]
** Residuals
- CFD codes iterate to solve systems of simultaneous equations
- The lower the residuals the more exact the solution is
- Checks should be made to ensure that sufficient convergence has been achieved
- Converge solution down to 1 \times 10^-3 and plot key results
- Further converge down to 1 \times 10^-4 and plot key results
- There should not be significant difference (within acceptable range)
