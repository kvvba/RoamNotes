#+title: Eulerian-Eulerian model

An Eulerian [[id:d2c3d66b-ecdc-45dc-8ba2-323bb1a9cf94][Multiphase flow modelling]] technique. It is one of the most complex and computationally expensive multiphase models. More complex than [[id:29714690-47a1-460c-9248-26e8188d0a0e][Eulerian-Mixture (Algebraic Slip Model (ASM))]] at approx. double the cost.

- Each phase has its own set of continuity and momentum equations
- Phase coupling is achieved through pressure and interphase exchange coefficients
- These correlations/models can be changed to model different regimes
  - e.g. bubble flow, granular flow, slurry flows, sedimentation, bubble columns, vertical risers, fluidized beds

Size and shape of particles ...
- Do not appear in the transport equations
- Information lost in the averaging process
- Determine the characteristics of the flow
- Appear in the drag and lift force definitions
