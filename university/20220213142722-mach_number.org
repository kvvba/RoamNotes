#+title: Mach number

* Mach number
Mach number (Ma) = v/a
Where v is the velocity of the fluid, and a is the speed of sound in the fluid.

* Speed of sound in a fluid
a = (\gamma Rt)^-0.5
Where \gamma is the air-ration of specific heats, t is static temperature, and R is the gas constant.
\gamma = 1.4, R = 287 J/kgK
