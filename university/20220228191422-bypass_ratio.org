#+title: Bypass ratio

BPR = m_b' / m_c'

Where m_b' is the bypass mass flow rate, and m_c' is the core mass flow rate.

* Implications on engine design
Increasing the bypass ratio increases [[id:6e7e33eb-420b-4517-8993-5d24babea27c][Engine thrust]] while maintaining [[id:7ba9790c-aa85-443d-b250-07b85b094ebe][Propulsive efficiency]].
However there are a number of drawbacks/limitations, the main theme of which being an increased engine size.

Design limitations:
- The payoff in term of [[id:da543acc-5803-4881-bb4e-b475f69a38d8][Specific fuel consumption]] reduces as bypass ratio increases.
- Increased weight and drag
- Reduced payload
- Space under aircraft
  - Wings need to be further from ground
- Impact of engine on wing aerodynamic performance
- Longer undercarriage (heavier)
- As BPR increases, fan diameter increases and can cause shock waves
  - Source of loss, decreasing fan efficiency
  - Places limit on LP turbine speed
    - Higher LP turbine speed allows for fewer stages
    - This can be resolved by using an epicyclic gearbox to run both fan and LP turbine at optimum speed
      - Cooling vital for gearbox using oil, cooled by a heat exchanger in the bypass duct

Design benefits:
- Reduction in noise perceived on the ground
  - Core flow is very hot, fast, and turbulent, creating noise
  - Slower, cooler bypass flow surrounding the core flow dissipates the sound
  - This reduces noise charges at airports
