#+title: Co-rotating turbine

As opposed to [[id:f7e74026-223b-406b-8bbf-2b088f80183f][Contra-rotating turbine]]s.

The gas path takes several turns, the exit from the first turbine must be turned a great deal in the second nozzle guide vane to present it to the second turbine blade at the correct angle. The annulus height from the first to second set of vanes is increasing to match the second turbine blade annulus height - so the air is turning and diverging at the same time giving rise to recirculation and increasing secondary losses, requiring a very careful design profile.
