#+title: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)

- SPH is a meshless [[id:d2c3d66b-ecdc-45dc-8ba2-323bb1a9cf94][Multiphase flow modelling]] approach
- Conservation of mass is guaranteed, due to the representation of a fluids by particles
- Conservation of momentum is satisfied due to the symmetry condition in the momentum equations
- Interface is naturally represented by particles of different phases, no interface tracking needed
- SPH allows for complex geometries, large deformations, moving boundaries and free-surface simulations
- Thermal effects included using energy equations
- modelling of gases, liquids, and solids with same SPH model equations
