#+title: Dimensional analysis

Increases efficiency of experiments by reducing number of data points which need to be measured.

* Buckingham Pi theorum
If there are n variables in a problem and these variables contain m primary dimensions (e.g. M,L,T), the equation relating all the variables will have (n-m) dimensionless groups.

e.g. drag on a sphere
\Pi_1 = \rho^a V^b D^c F
(M/L^3)^a (L/t)^b (L)^c (ML/t^2) = M^0 L^0 t^0
\Pi_1 = (F)/(\rho V^2 D^2)
n - m = 4 - 3 , so only 1 dimensionless group in this case.

* Plotting
Plot dimensional groups against each-other to produce curve. Then simple to extract data from the curve if other variables are known. Prevents a chart with many different curves for different values of a variable.
