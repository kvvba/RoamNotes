#+title: Turbulence intensity

Useful parameter for quantifying turbulence levels, often expressed as a percentage.
Typical engineering values of 1%-20%
Can be measured experimentally.

T_i = ((\oline{u'^2})^{0.5})/(\oline{u}) = U_eddy / \oline{u}

Where u' is the [[id:14e9937f-54c1-49ca-8a4f-d6536dcd26c5][Turbulent velocity fluctuation]].
