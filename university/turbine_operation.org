#+title: Turbine operation

A turbine is composed of a series of rotors and stators (nozzle guide vanes).

- Nozzle guide vanes (NGV)
  - Accelerates gas and turns it to optimum angle for rotor blades
  - Operate in a choked condition (see: [[id:83203801-5c4e-4923-a8be-591387858834][Convergent-divergent flow]]) using converging passage
  - They swirl the air in the direction required by the rotor blade
  - The effective flow area sets the compressor working line, hence surge margin and max efficiency point (see: [[id:102568d2-a06b-416f-9037-1ce6c86164db][Turbine efficiency]])
  - Controls engine internal air pressures and hence bearing loads
  - It has a complex cooling system
- Rotor blades
  - Utilise the kinetic energy of the air to generate power
  - They are highly stressed due to the large centrifugal forces and temperatures
  - They are invariably cooled for high pressure stages, later stages may be uncooled
