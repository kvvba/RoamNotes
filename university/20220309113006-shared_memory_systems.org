#+title: Shared memory architecture

In a [[id:725c9328-6390-45b6-aaab-2d73693f1ded][HPC]] using a shared memory system, the processors share a single bank of memory.

Shared memory architecture is easier to program and convert CFD code to.

- Any processor can easily access data in the memory when running in parallel
- The data is stored in the same place for all processes
- If one process makes a modification to the values in the array, the other processes will see this change immediately
