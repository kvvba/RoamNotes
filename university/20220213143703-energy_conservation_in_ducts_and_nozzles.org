#+title: Energy conservation in ducts and nozzles

Assuming no energy losses in duct/nozzle. No work/heat transfer into or out of the system.

Measuring static pressure with a pressure gauge at the inlet and outlet (points 1 and 2).

Can use the [[id:2aaabf68-4c99-46dd-8358-73edb77da674][Bernoulli equation]] to calculate pressure/velocity.
Not generally used for gas turbine engines as it is not valid for compressible flow, and most areas of the engine involve compressible flow.

Can also use the [[id:4124edc3-1987-49c7-92cd-82f17ccfe2a3][Steady flow energy equation (SFEE)]].
