Aspect ratio = chord / blade height

Axial gaps give space for the gas to expand and to dampen damaging resonances.

Angle of the diverging passage is known as the hade angle. The greater the angle, the shorter the turbine arrangement - however this increases the probability of disturbance of the gas boundary layer, setting up secondary flows and loss of efficiency.

The hub-tip ratio influences the aerofoil form, to maintain the correct angle of attack.
