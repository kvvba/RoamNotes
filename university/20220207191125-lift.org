#+title: Lift

Pressure on upper surface of aerofoil is lower than pressure on lower surface, producing lift.
Pressure acts normally to the surface, only vertical component creates lift.

P_1 pressure on upper surface
P_2 pressure on lower surface
P_2 > P_1 lift generated

Can be calculated by integrating pressures or using velocity around the airfoil using [[id:2aaabf68-4c99-46dd-8358-73edb77da674][Bernoulli equation]].

U_1 velocity on upper surface
U_2 velocity on lower surface
U_1 > U_2 lift generated

* Formulae
** Lift force from pressure
L = ∮(p_s-p_\infin)sin(\theta + \pi)ds = -∮(p_s-p_\infin)sin(\theta)ds
Where p_s is pressure normal to surface
** Lift force from velocity (Bernoulli equation)
P_2 + U^2_2 = P_1 + U^2_1
Where P is static pressure, and density is constant.

** Thin aerofoil theory
C_L = 2\pi\alpha for symmetric aerofoil
C_L = 2\pi(\alpha - \alpha_0) for cambered aerofoil
Where \alpha_0 is the angle where the aerofoil produces no lift, the zero lift angle
Only applicable at small angle of attack \alpha
** Lift slope
*** 2D
\alpha_0 = dC_L/d\alpha

dC_L/d\alpha = (\alpha_0/(1 + (\alpha_0/(\pi \cdot AR)))
