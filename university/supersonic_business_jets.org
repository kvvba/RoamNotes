#+title: Supersonic business jets

- Number of billionaires in the world is growing
- Private jets operate usually on a corporate basis to transport individuals or groups of 8-10 passengers
- Often the aircraft needs to reposition for next job, this is non-revenue flight
- If repositioning can be done supersonically, crew time saved and aircraft utilisation increased
- However aircraft must be able to fly supersonically over land
  - Currently not allowed
- Unlikely to be environmentally friendly aircraft
