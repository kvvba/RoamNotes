#+title: Structured meshing

Regular, structured grid using squares or distorted squares. Easy to loop over and reference neighbouring nodes.
Structured code is becoming fahsionable again due to its computational efficiency for very large simulations.

Three-dimensional structured meshes are comprised of hexahedra, typically cubes.

* Advantages
- Computationally efficient
- Low memory usage
- Can give better convergence
- Good for high-order CFD
- Low cell counts achievable with careful design
- Easier to program
- Easier to parallelise
- Easy to control cell count
- Easy to refine areas of interest
- Advantageous near to walls
- High-aspect ratio cells to capture boundary layers and shear layers

* Disadvantages
- Hard to automate
- Difficult to mesh complex geometry

* Types of structured meshes
** Cartesian mesh
- Can be non-uniform
  - Cell size changes
** Curvilinear mesh
- Structured but wrapped to a curve geometry
** Chimera/overset mesh
- Interpolation between multiple structured meshes
- Stitched together
- Better for complex geometry
