#+title: CFD strength and weaknesses

* Advantages over experiments
- CFD can be used to achieve conditions not possible to achieve in a wind tunnel
- CFD is not limited by wind tunnel speed, allowing for high velocity cases to be tested
- Experiments are expensive to run and maintain
- Experimental test programs can be very expensive
- Wind tunnel walls can create a blockage effect that significantly impacts results
- CFD can provide significant amount of detail about a flow situation
- CFD can provide an effective means for evaluation "what if" scenarios
- Easy to change model geometry
- Easy visualisation of results using enhanced graphics
- Can run optimisation studies with thousands of simulations

* Disadvantages
- Turbulence modelling is a big challenge
- Geometry handling and meshing can be time consuming
- CFD requires careful and methodical validation
