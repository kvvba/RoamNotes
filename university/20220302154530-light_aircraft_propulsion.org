#+title: Light aircraft propulsion

- The majority of propulsion units for light aircraft are [[id:28e3da39-b63d-4b08-8636-e3c9f23146c0][reciprocating spark-ignition engines]] using aviation gasoline (AVGAS) driving propellers
- There have been some diesel engines due to their low [[id:da543acc-5803-4881-bb4e-b475f69a38d8][Specific fuel consumption]], but not widely used
- The gasoline engines work on the Otto four stroke cycle of:
  - Induction
  - Compressions
  - Expansion
  - Exhaust
- The advantages of a piston engine is that they are relatively simple to construct and maintain
- Disadvantages:
  - Lack of power, especially at altitude (hence usage of super/turbochargers)
  - Relatively low airspeed due to propeller limitations
  - Lower reliability compares to gas turbine
