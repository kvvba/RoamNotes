#+title: Smoothing

Also known as residual averaging, smoothing is a method of increasing allowable [[id:749b6fab-dcdb-4002-a20c-27ec3eefe53a][Courant number]] to improve the stability of steady flow in [[id:b1d6e8fe-ce6a-431e-96bd-6a70ec809625][Explicit schemes]].

This is achieved by spatially averaging the residuals.

T^(n+1) = T^n + R^n

The residual R is replaced with a new residual computed using residual information from neighbouring cells.
This can be applied 'per stage' in [[id:a476d1c7-c504-46f0-b590-f1d9bb1c7d85][Runge-Kutta method]] or per iteration.
