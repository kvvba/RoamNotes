#+title: Binary search algorithm

A [[id:2e4bd6c1-028a-41af-a1b3-ee9175cce437][CFD optimisation]] technique for 1 design variable. It is therefore a 2D problem once the objective function is added.

* Pros and cons
- Simple to describe
- Simple to implement
- Robust
- More efficient algorithms, but less robust

* Algorithm
1. Step forward to find approximate minimum in big steps until f(x) starts to increase
2. Cut \Delta x in half (binary search)
3. Step forward until f(x) increases
4. Cut \Delta x in half
