#+title: Multigrid

Multigrid is a popular method of [[id:01642bd1-dc9b-409c-8c2c-629d360f1711][convergence acceleration]] for [[id:9144ea7d-bb69-4755-99f5-ceeffe2bb21f][Steady flow]].

Multigrid method are similar to [[id:a7d7763c-2bd2-4bea-ab95-08de63774596][Mesh sequencing]]. Information is propagated between coarse and fine meshes at every iteration.

In terms of errors - solution contains both high and low frequency errors.
High frequency errors tend to be reduced much faster than low frequency errors (low frequency error tends to slow down convergence).

Transferring to a coarse grid, the low frequency errors become high frequency and are more readily damped.
