#+title: Eulerian thin film model (ETFM)

- An Eulerian [[id:d2c3d66b-ecdc-45dc-8ba2-323bb1a9cf94][Multiphase flow model]] for liquid films
- This model uses depth averaged equation to model the flow of film on a wall
- It is suitable for representing very thin liquid flows on wall surfaces
- It uses coarse grids, giving significantly reduced computation cost compared to a [[id:d793a2ea-40c2-4040-90ea-0b029aa8f51e][Volume of fluid (VOF)]] model
- The ETFM needs coupling with other methods to model two-phase flow away from the walls
- [[id:b3461fb1-cdf8-496c-972e-e174a608db47][DPM]]-ETFM coupling is now common in commercial CFD codes
- [[id:d793a2ea-40c2-4040-90ea-0b029aa8f51e][VOF]]-ETFM coupling is less common but is starting to be more widely applied in recent releases of commercial software
