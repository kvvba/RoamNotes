#+title: Dirichlet boundary condition

Also known as a "type 1" [[id:438274de-8894-4ba7-9f51-715e206bf46a][Boundary condition]].

This is specified as the _value_ of the unknown at the boundary.
Dirichlet boundary condition is useful to, for example, set the velocity profile at inlet.

* Wall boundary conditions
Can set a constant temperature at the wall, T_i = 300K
