#+title: Application errors

- Geometry model errors
  - Geometry incorrectly defined
  - Errors in measurement of geometry
  - Important features missed
- Grid generation
  - Highly skewed elements
  - Large expansion ratios
  - Inadequate resolution
- Boundary conditions
  - Inappropriate boundary conditions (e.g. steady for LES)
  - Influence of boundary conditions (i.e. too close)
  - Do not represent physical reality
